    Fixes bug `#2039498
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2039498>`__ where the
    grafana docker volume was bind mounted over Grafana plugins installed at
    image build time. This is fixed by copying the dashboards into the
    container from an existing bind mount instead of using the ``grafana``
    volume. This however leaves behind the volume which can be removed by
    setting ``grafana_remove_old_volume`` to ``true``. Please note that any
    plugins installed via the cli directly and not through kolla will be lost
    when doing this. In a future release ``grafana_remove_old_volume`` will
    default to ``true``.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``grafana`` volume is no longer used. If you wish to automatically
    remove the old volume, set ``grafana_remove_old_volume`` to ``true``. Note
    that doing this will lose any plugins installed via the cli directly and
    not through kolla. If you have previously installed Grafana plugins via the
    Grafana UI, or CLI, you must change to installing them at image `build time
    <https://docs.openstack.org/kolla/latest/admin/image-building.html#dockerfile-customisation>`__.
    The grafana volume, which will contain existing custom plugins, will be
    automatically removed in the D release.
