    Enable elevated access for project scoped service role
    in Ironic.  Ironic recently started to enforce new policies
    and scope. And Ironic is one of the sole openstack project
    which need system scope for some admin related api calls.
    However Ironic also started to allow project-scope behaviour
    for service role with setting
    ``rbac_service_role_elevated_access``. This change enables
    this setting to get similar behaviour of service role as other
    openstack projects.
