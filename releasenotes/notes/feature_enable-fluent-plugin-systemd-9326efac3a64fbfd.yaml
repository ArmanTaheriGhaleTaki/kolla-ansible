    Implements [Enable Fluentd Plugin Systemd].
    Adds the needed changes and configurations in order to use the
    fluentd plugin, systemd, to read logs from /var/log/journal by
    default. This allows us to read and manipulate this logs for
    monitoring purposes.

    These logs will be sent to OpenSearch by default, to disable this
    behavior, set the value of the variable ``enable_fluentd_systemd``
    to ``false`` in the configuration file ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``.

    By default, when enabling central logging, we also enable the
    ``systemd`` plugin. To disable this behavior when central logging
    is enabled, set the value of the variable ``enable_fluentd_systemd``
    to ``false`` in the configuration file ``/etc/kolla/globals.yml``.
