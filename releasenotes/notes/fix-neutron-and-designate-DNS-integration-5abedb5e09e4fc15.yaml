upgrade:
  - |
    Changes configuration variable ``designate_enable_notifications_sink``
    to ``no`` which configures notifications for designate in neutron, nova
    and control deployment of ``designate-sink`` which is now optional.

    Operators that want to keep the previous behavior should set this to
    ``true``.
features:
  - |
    Adds new variables to be used by the neutron role,
    ``neutron_dns_integration`` and ``neutron_dns_domain``.
    They allow to enable/disable internal/external DNS integrations,
    or their combinations.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes configuration of DNS integrations. See `LP##2049503
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/2049503>`__,
    `DNS Integration
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-dns-int.html>`__
    and the `DNS Integration with an External Service
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-dns-int-ext-serv.html#config-dns-int-ext-serv>`__
